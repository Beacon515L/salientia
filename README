# Salientia
## Recursive dependency-traversing batch-engraver for GNU Lilypond
### by Liam Greenough - beacon515@gmail.com

This is one of several batch-engravers I wrote for the Majora Opera project, headed up by Miguel Bulteau (mbulteau.com).  It is highly unfinished and haggardly written, but does the job.  It is designed to supercede a set of batch scripts (engrave.sh) that use xargs to do the same thing less efficiently.

Currently Linux-only, working on Windows support once I finish everything else.

Build dependencies: CMake, g++, nothing else I've noticed that your preferred distro's base-devel package wouldn't pull.

Runtime dependencies: GNU Lilypond, and, well, bash, I guess?

Code is very ugly and WIP and could stand redesign once it is functional.  I'll get around to that.

## Build
```
cmake .
make
```

Simple as that.  This isn't a French historical melodrama in five acts.

## Usage
```
salientia [directory of .ly files]
```

This will make Salientia recurse the specified directory, identify all .ly files and all other .ly files referenced by \include predicates, check each file's timestamps against those of their output files (currently, only PDF is checked, this might change soon; this is the same check Frescobaldi makes when deciding whether or not to display the PDF view) and finally uses this list to spawn threads.  Optionally, it can alternatively be dumped to stdout (e.g. for piping to xargs or your preferred thread pool).

There are flags in need of listing and testing as of latest comit. //TODO

Many Lilypond users, and the Majora Opera team are one case, separate their musical definitions from score and part definitions.  This leads to some files not ever requiring engraving and including them in a large batch-process wastes time (as usually Lilypond will still fully initialize and produce no output, or even crash).  For such files, add:
```
%NOENGRAVE
```
somewhere in the file, and Salientia will immediately prune it from the engraving list.  To Lilypond itself and any other frontend, %NOENGRAVE is just a comment and affects nothing else.

## TODO
- Cross-platform support
- Checks for other output types (MIDI, Postscript, SVG. etc.)
- Memory-checking and selective serial engraving (request by Miguel Jesus - AbsentiaDie)
- Engrave timing and intelligent thread dispatching (distant horizon)
